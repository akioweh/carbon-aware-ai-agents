  description: |
    API for tracking and retrieving data center load and greenness metrics.
    
    This API provides historical and current data about:
    - **Load**: Data center load ranging from 0-50 arbitrary units (50 being capacity)
    - **Greenness**: Energy greenness score from 0-100 (higher values indicate greener energy)
    
    Data is collected at 5-minute intervals and is pattern-based to enable forecasting 
    and task scheduling.
